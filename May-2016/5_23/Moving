While itâ€™s pretty easy to move around Atom by clicking
with the mouse or using the arrow keys, there are some
keybindings that may help you keep your hands on the
keyboard and navigate around a little faster.

First of all, Atom ships with many of the basic
 Emacs keybindings for navigating a document. To
  go up and down a single character, you can use
  ctrl-P and ctrl-N. To go left and right a single
  character, you can use ctrl-B and ctrl-F. These
   are the equivalent of using the arrow keys,
   though some people prefer not having to move t
   heir hands to where the arrow keys are located
   on their keyboard.
